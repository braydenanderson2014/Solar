@Starting Program
-Step 1: Start the Program Application.
-Step 2: Start Setup by typing the number 1 and hitting [Enter] Pressing 2 and [Enter] will quit the program
-Step 3: [WARNING]:{The Program will Halt Setup and wait for user Response} The program will prompt you a question
asking if you want to install the dependencies in the "C:" Drive folder, Type "Y" or "N" and then press [Enter]
*if you chose "YES"
  -you will be asked to type out the path of the directory you would like to install dependencies in.
  EX Path: "C:\Users\ *User* \Documents" -Note: *User* represents whatever profile you use. do not type *user* as the program will fail to find the path
  You will not have to type the "C:" part or the "\" 
  EX of how to do this... Users [Enter] *User* [Enter] Documents [Enter] done [Enter] -Note: done will not be added as part of the path
  When you type done, the program will then convert the words you typed into a path, then it will install dependencies
  
*if you chose "No"
 -program will search for a usable drive using brute force methods... ie trying letters of the alphabet with a ":" until it finds a valid path;
 -program will then install dependencies
