@Starting Program
-Step 1: Start the Program Application.
-Step 2: Start Setup by typing the number 1 (or typing "SS" ) and hitting [Enter] 
  * Pressing 2 (or typing "MS") and [Enter] will start a Manual Setup (Currently this feature is not yet available) 
  * Pressing 3 (or typing "SP") and [Enter] will start program (Warning this feature is not yet available)
  * Pressing 4 (or typing "QP") and [Enter] will quit the program
-Step 3: [WARNING]:{The Program will Halt Setup and wait for user Response} The program will prompt you a question
asking if you want to install the dependencies in the "C:" Drive folder, Type "Y" or "N" and then press [Enter]
*if you chose "YES"
  -You will be asked to type out the path of the directory you would like to install dependencies in. (Do not include "C". the drive is already set.)
  EX Path: "C:\Users\ *User* \Documents" -Note: *User* represents whatever profile you use. do not type *user* as the program will fail to find the path. Do not type the "\" or the "/" as the program will automatically add them. Just type the folder name "Users" [Enter] "Documents" [Enter] ... Type [done] when your directory path is acurate.
   You will not have to type the "C:" part or the "\" 
  EX of how to do this... Users [Enter] *User* [Enter] Documents [Enter] done [Enter] -Note: done will not be added as part of the path
  When you type done, the program will then convert the words you typed into a path, then it will install dependencies
  
*if you chose "No"
 -Program will search for a usable drive using brute force methods... ie trying letters of the alphabet with a ":" until it finds a valid path;
 -Program will then install dependencies
 -Program will ask if you want to install dependacies in drive D as in most windows preinstalled environments, drive d is used as a recovery drive.
